# MultiThreaded Web Server in C#

This is a custom multi-threaded web server built in C# to understand the inner workings of HTTP, TCP/IP, and multithreading. The project is developed step by step to learn about network programming and concurrency.

## Features
- Custom HTTP server that listens on a specific port.
- Supports GET requests to serve static HTML pages.
- Handles multiple client connections simultaneously using multithreading.

## Project Structure
- `Program.cs`: Entry point for the web server.
- `HttpServer.cs`: Core server logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- `README.md`: Documentation and explanation of the project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

## Next Steps
- Add support for POST requests.
- Implement routing to handle multiple endpoints.
- Optimize performance with thread pooling.
